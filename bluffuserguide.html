   <h2>How to play bluff game?</h2> 
   <p>Like a regular card game, a group of players gather and shuffle the cards. The game begins with the first player placing one or more cards while either telling the truth or lying. For instance, if the player places “the king”, he/she can claim it as “a queen”, “a jack”, or “any other card”, or truthfully state it as “a king” itself. Other players can raise a challenge if they suspect deception/ cheat. If a player falsely claims, “a queen” as “a king” and gets caught, they receive a penalty, while the challenger earns an extra chance. However, if the challenger is wrong, he/she receives the penalty. Players can choose to “Pass” if they don't want to participate in the round, but they can still “Raise” a challenge. A round concludes only when all players "Pass”, or someone “Raise” the challenge. The player who initiated the round selects the bluff text. The winner is the player who clears his/her cards first.
